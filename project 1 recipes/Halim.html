        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup wheat</li>
            <li>1/2 cup lentils</li>
            <li>200g meat (optional)</li>
            <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tsp ginger paste</li>
            <li>1 tsp turmeric powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp cumin powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp coriander powder</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>4 cups water or broth</li>
            <li>Fresh cilantro and fried onions for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the wheat and lentils thoroughly. Soak them in water for at least 2 hours or overnight for best results.</li>
            <li>If using meat, cut it into small pieces. In a large pot, heat some oil and sauté the meat until browned. Remove and set aside.</li>
            <li>In the same pot, add more oil if needed and sauté the chopped onions until golden brown. Add garlic and ginger paste, cooking for another minute.</li>
            <li>Add turmeric, cumin, coriander powder, salt, and pepper. Stir well to combine the spices with the onion mixture.</li>
            <li>Drain the soaked wheat and lentils, then add them to the pot. Stir to coat them with the spices.</li>
            <li>Add water or broth to the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, for about 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. Add more water if necessary.</li>
            <li>If using meat, add it back into the pot during the last hour of cooking.</li>
            <li>Once the wheat and lentils are soft and have a porridge-like consistency, adjust seasoning as needed.</li>
            <li>Serve hot, garnished with fresh cilantro and fried onions.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2></h2>Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Soaking the wheat and lentils beforehand helps them cook faster and more evenly.</li>
            <li>Stirring occasionally while simmering prevents the halim from sticking to the bottom of the pot.</li>
            <li>Adjust the consistency by adding more water or broth if needed.</li>
            <li>For a vegetarian version, you can skip the meat and add more lentils and vegetables.</li>
            <li>Halim tastes even better the next day, so consider making it in advance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Enjoy your delicious Halim!</p>
